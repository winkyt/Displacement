", "compensation": "Relocated villagers from the Manwan project suffered the greatest material loss, including loss of home and arable agricultural land.  However, the compensation they received was insufficient. The compensation design was based on the economic conditions in late 1980s, but the Chinese economy boomed in the early 1990s. Because of this, resettled groups were not able to buy construction materials to build their new homes and adjust to their new environments. Meanwhile, some families had to relocate again due to landslides and poor quality of new home construction. The Chinese government provided new agricultural land, but the quality and quantity decreased due to the limited amount. Some farmers had to spend more time to their fields as a result ", "labor": "Resettled villagers from Manwan experienced a dramatic change at the beginning of resettlement. Some families received less land when they resettled. Because they now owned less land, these farmers were not able to protect their families from hunger, thus, they had to borrow money. Meanwhile, farmers were looking for new income sources, switching their jobs to fishing, transportation services, or wage labors in Yunnanï¿½s urban areas (Matthews and Kim, 2015). After nearly 20 years of resettlement, studies still found that labor and financial resource were depressed.", "demographic": "The ethic Han is the dominant group at this dam site.

Displaced populations from Dachaoshan considered in this study were relocated far from their home villages. In general, they received better housing accommodations and almost equal sized, but lower quality, farmland (P. Wang, Lassoie, et al., 2013). The average compensation amount for Manwan and Dachaoshan was 4,957 Chinese yuan, after adjustment for inflation (Tilt, 2015)", "labor": "For Dachaoshan, the government helped clear the land but the new irrigation system provided limited water resources. The lower quality of farmland forced some farmers to quit their original agricultural plants.", "demographic": "The ethic Han is the dominant group at this dam site. The non-resettled villages of Dachaoshan is home to a greater diversity of ethnic groups than the new, resettled villages. The resettled villages only have Han and Yi people. In the Dachaoshan site, the resettled group has a large portion of people are missing from between age 31 to 40.  Also, compared to the other communities, the Dachaoshan resettled communities have a relatively small portion of youth (the 0 to 18 demographic category).\nThe results indicate that the Dachaoshan resettled communities might face problems of labor shortages but the influence remains unknown due to limited evidence.

The overall displaced population is greater than that of either of the previous two dams. The actual compensation did not cover people's losses of homes and land (P. Wang, Lassoie, et al., 2013). The housing condition were better but not everyone received the same quality of house. The loss of farmland was compensated but the government only provided a limited amount of new agricultural land to displaced people. The average compensated amount was 11,280 Chinese yuan (Tilt, 2015).

Some resettled villagers from Xiaowan started their new life in the new communities around the time when the survey was conducted (2010), while others were resettled in 2002.The government tried to teach Xiaowan farmers to plant tobacco but the time to market is relatively longer than their former products (P.
